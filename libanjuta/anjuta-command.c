/**
 * SECTION: anjuta-command
 * @short_description: System for creating objects that provide a standard 
 *					   interface to external components (libraries, processes,
 *					   etc.) 
 * @see_also: #AnjutaAsyncCommand, #AnjutaSyncCommand
 * @include libanjuta/anjuta-command.h
 *
 * #AnjutaCommand is the base class for objects that are designed to provide 
 * a layer of abstraction between UI code and some other component, like a 
 * library or child process. AnjutaCommand provides a simple and consistent
 * interface for plugins to interact with these components without needing 
 * to concern themselves with the exact details of how these components work.
 * 
 * To create command objects, plugins derive them from an #AnjutaCommand 
 * subclass like #AnjutaAsyncCommand, which runs commands in another thread or 
 * #AnjutaSyncCommand, which runs commands synchronously.
 *
 * These classes determine how ::run is called and how signals are emitted.
 * ::run is responsible for actually doing the work of the command. It is the 
 * responsiblity of the command object that does a certain task to implement 
 * ::run to do its job. Everything else is normally implemented by its parent
 * classes at this point
 *
 * For an example of how to use #AnjutaCommand, see the Subversion and Git 
 * plugins.
